        Associate Software Engineer with a pension for problem solving,
        technical accuracy, and a love of agile development! Currently focused
        on the Angular framework and front-end development while also gowing my
        skills in backend architecture through SQL and the .Net framework. I'm
        also a former educator for UMKC and tutor for Womenâ€™s+ Web Development
        bootcamp through LaunchCode. The tech field is such a dynamic space, I
        can't wait to see where it takes me :)
