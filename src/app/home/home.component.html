          Hi! I'm a Software Engineer with a pension for problem solving,
          technical accuracy, and a love of agile development! Currently focused
          on the Angular framework and front-end development while also gowing
          my skills in backend architecture through SQL and the .Net framework.
          I'm also a former educator for UMKC and tutor for Womenâ€™s+ Web
          Development bootcamp through LaunchCode. After the big move back home
          to Seattle, I can't wait to see where tech and travel :)
